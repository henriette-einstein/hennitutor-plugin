description: Initialize vault settings and create project configuration
allowed-tools: Bash, Write
---

Set up the configuration for the currently open vault.

## Steps

1. **Ask for language**: Ask the user which language they want to use when creating new
   notes. Present these options clearly:
   - English — default
   - German (Deutsch)
   - French (Français)
   - Spanish (Español)
   - Other — let the user type their own language name

   Wait for the user's answer before proceeding.

2. **Create config directory** in the current vault root:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude
   ```

3. **Write `.claude/CLAUDE.md`** with the chosen language. Use the exact language name
   the user selected (e.g. "German", "English", "French"). Replace `{LANGUAGE}` below:
   ```bash
   cat > .claude/CLAUDE.md << 'CLAUDEEOF'
   # Vault Configuration

   > Generated by `/init`. Edit this file to change settings.

   ## Writing Language

   Write all vault notes in **{LANGUAGE}**.
   CLAUDEEOF
   ```

4. **Confirm** to the user:
   > Vault initialized. New notes will be written in **{LANGUAGE}**.
   > Settings saved to `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — Claude Code loads this file automatically.
